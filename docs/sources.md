Sources
=======

Sources are naturally occurring spots where elements converge.

It's strongly recommended to explore a bit and find at least one sources for each element.
It is also recommended to mark their spots to find them easier again when you need them.

### Recovery
While extracting elements frome a source its getting drained of its elements, once its completly empty it enters the recovery phase.
Durring this phase the source specila effect will change to small dots spread out, the source is filling its container up, this will take __5 to 10 minutes__.

### Receptacle
You can move sources using a [Source Receptacle]. Simply __right-click the source with the receptacle__ and __right-click again where you want to place the source back__.
