Pure Infuser
============

The Pure Infuser is the most powerful crafting tool. It uses pedestals to channel all four elements into a single item.
To operate, it needs to be circled with each of the four pedestals, each being provided with the correct element using [pipes].
Once this setup is done, you can start crafting by putting the correct ingredient on each pedestal and the main one on the pure infuser.

### Pedestals

There are four pedestals, one for each element. You need to place them on the side of the pure infuser with a two block gap. Eache pedestal need to be provided with the correct element using [pipes].
