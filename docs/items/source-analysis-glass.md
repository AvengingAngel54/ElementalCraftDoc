Source Analysis Glass
=====================

The source Analysis Glass can be used to analyse [sources]. It will show you what traits the source has.

Every analysis will consume a [Springaline shard] from your inventory. so you need to have at least one in your inventory.
You can either analyse a source by right-clicking it with the glass or from a [receptacle] by placing it in the upper right slot of the analysis GUI.

[sources]: ../../sources
[Springaline shard]: ../springaline-shard
[receptacle]: ../items/source-receptacle
