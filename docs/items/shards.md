Element Shards
==============

Shards are a small condensed form of elements. They exists in two forms: normal and powerful.
You can switch between the two form in a crafting table with a ratio of 1:9.  
Powerful shards are basically compression of normal shards.

### Acquisition
__Shards can be obtained by killing mobs__, the type of mob is used to determine which shards you will get:

* Fire: creepers, nether mobs...
* Water: drowned, squids, guardians, fishes...
* Earth: zombie, skeletons, undead...
* Air: spiders, end mobs...

### Usage
__Shards are optional__ in every craft and the whole mod can be done without them.
They are used in an [Evaporator] to create elements or in a [Gem Crystalizer] to increase the chance of getting a better gem.

[Evaporator]: ..:../blocks/evaporator
[Gem Crystalizer]: ../../blocks/gem-crystalizer
