Element Shards
==============

Shards is a small condanced amount of elemnets. They exists in two forms: normal and powerfull.
You can switch between the two form in a grafting table with a ration 1 <-> 9.  
Powerfull shards are basically compression of normal shards.

Shards can be found by killing mobs, the type of mod is important to determine witch shards you will get:

* Fire: creepers, nether mobs...
* Water: downed, squids, guardians, fishes...
* Earth: zombie, skeletons, undead...
* Air: spiders, end mobs...


Shards are optional in every craft and the whole mod can be done without them.
They are use in an [Evaporator] to create elements or in a [Gem Crystalizer] to increase the chance of getting a better gem.
